   The Sentry DLL (Dynamic-Link Library) included with the Sentry 
   Windows SDK include built-in spelling-checker dialog boxes you can 
   easily invoke from your application. The DLL performs all 
   initialization needed by most applications to access SSCE, including 
   opening lexicons and setting options. Using the DLL, your application can</P>

   </UL>
  <P>
   You don't need to use the dialog boxes built-in to the Sentry DLL - 
   you can write your own user interface. The Spelling-Checker dialog 
   boxes are intended to provide a general-purpose spelling-checker 
   capability to applications quickly. If your application has more 
   sophisticated requirements, you may want to access the core Sentry 
   API directly. The core Sentry API is described in <A HREF="coreapi.htm">Using
    Sentry's Core API</A>; see <A HREF="#How2CallCoreAPI">How to call 
   Sentry's Core API</A> for information on calling the Core API using 
   the Sentry DLL. You can maintain the behavior of the built-in dialog 
   boxes while changing their appearance. See <A HREF="#How2ChangeDialogApp">How
    to change the appearance of Sentry dialog boxes</A> for more information.</P>
  <P>
   You can change the language of the text displayed by the dialogs; see <A HREF="#How2Localize">How
    to localize Sentry's built-in dialog boxes</A> for more information.</P>
  <P>
   When you use the Sentry DLL, most of the &quot;housekeeping&quot; 
   work associated with using the Sentry engine, such as opening 
   sessions and lexicons and setting options, is done for you. See <A HREF="winsdk.htm#How2InstallRunTime">How
    to install the Sentry run-time software with your applications</A> 
   for information on how to configure the Sentry DLL to open the 
   correct set of lexicons and set the correct options.</P>
  <P>
   Operation of the dialog boxes from a user's perspective is described 
   in an on-line help file accessible via Help buttons in the dialog boxes.</P>

  <P>
   Before your application can use the Sentry DLL, it must call the <A HREF="winref.htm#SSCE_SetKey">SSCE_SetKey</A> 
   function and pass a valid license key. A license key is provided by 
   Wintertree Software with the Sentry Software Development Kit. The 
   license key is an eight-digit hexadecimal number.</P>
  <P>
   If the SSCE_SetKey function is not called, or the license key passed 
   is not valid, the Sentry DLL will not work correctly.</P>
  <P>
   The SSCE_SetKey function needs to be called only once, but there is 
   no harm in calling it more than once.</P>
  <P>
   <B><I>How to find your license key</I></B>:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI>
   <P>
    If you received the Sentry SDK on CD-ROM, your license key is 
    provided on a paper sheet in the Sentry package.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    If you received the Sentry SDK electronically, your license key is 
    provided in the e-mail message which the Sentry software was attached 
    to, or which described how to download the Sentry software.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    If you purchased Sentry from <A HREF="http://www.netsales.com">Netsales</A>,
     your license key is located in file key.txt, located in the ssce\sdk 
    directory where you installed the Sentry SDK.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   The license key is a hexadecimal number. You must pass your license 
   key to the SSCE_SetKey function using whatever mechanism is required 
   in your programming language to denote hexadecimal numbers. For 
   example, if your license key was 1234ABCD,</P>
  <UL>
   <LI>
   <P>
    In C or C++ call SSCE_SetKey(0x1234ABCD);</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    In Visual Basic call SSCE_SetKey(&amp;H1234ABCD)</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    In Delphi (Pascal) call SSCE_SetKey($1234ABCD);</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   If your programming language does not support hexadecimal constants, 
   you can convert the license key to decimal using a 
   hexadecimal-capable calculator. If you don't have such a calculator, 
   use the Windows calculator accessory in &quot;Scientific&quot; mode. 
   For example, 1234ABCD converted to decimal is 305441741.</P>

  <P>
   The <A HREF="winref.htm#SSCE_CheckCtrlDlg">SSCE_CheckCtrlDlg</A> 
   function interactively checks the contents of a text or rich-text 
   control. When you call SSCE_CheckCtrlDlg, words in the control are 
   checked according to the current spelling-checker options. If 
   SSCE_CheckCtrlDlg finds a problem, it displays a dialog box (the 
   Spelling-Checker dialog box) which the user interacts with to correct 
   or dispose of the problem. If no problems are detected, the dialog 
   box closes immediately.</P>
  <P>
   If the control being checked is an edit control or rich-edit control, 
   SSCE_CheckCtrlDlg can highlight the relevant word in the control when 
   a problem is detected. To enable this behavior, set the ES_NOHIDESEL 
   style in the control, or set the control's &quot;Hide Selection&quot; 
   property to False. If the control is a multi-line edit control, the 
   ES_AUTOVSCROLL style should be set to ensure the highlighted word can 
   be scrolled into view.</P>
  <P>
   Normally, SSCE_CheckCtrlDlg checks all the text in the control. 
   Optionally, it can check only the selected text.</P>
  <P>
   When SSCE_CheckCtrlDlg returns, all the text in the control (or just 
   the selected portion) has been checked, or the user canceled the 
   spelling check.</P>
  <P>
   A special form of the SSCE_CheckCtrlDlg function 
   (SSCE_CheckCtrlDlgTmplt) allows your application to specify the 
   dialog templates to be used in place of the templates built-in to the 
   Sentry DLL. For more information, see <A HREF="#How2ChangeDialogApp">How
    to change the appearance of Sentry's dialog boxes</A>.</P>
  <H4>
   <I><A NAME="ThirdPartyControls"></A>Checking third-party controls</I></H4>
  <P>
   SSCE_CheckCtrlDlg will work with standard Windows edit controls and 
   rich-edit controls. It will also work with other controls that 
   exhibit standard behavior in response to the following messages:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI>
   <P>
    EM_REPLACESEL<BR>
    <LI>EM_SETSEL<BR>
    <LI>WM_GETTEXT<BR>
    <LI>WM_GETTEXTLENGTH<BR>
    <LI>EM_SCROLLCARET<BR>
    <LI>EM_GETSEL<BR>
    <LI>EM_GETSELTEXT</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Note that many third-party text controls don't support the standard 
   messages, or behave in non-standard ways in response. Contact the 
   control's publisher or developer to determine if the control supports 
   these messages.</P>
  <P>
   The Sentry DLL determines how to communicate with a control from its 
   class name. The DLL recognizes the following class names:</P>
  <UL>
   <LI>
   <P>
    <B>Edit</B>: Standard edit controls<BR>
    <LI><B>RICHEDIT</B>: Standard version 1 rich-edit controls<BR>
    <LI><B>RichEdit20A</B>: Standard version 2 and 3 rich-edit controls</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Some controls subclass the standard controls but use different class 
   names. For example, the TRichEdit control included with Delphi 2.0 
   and later is a subclassed version of the &quot;RICHEDIT&quot; control 
   that uses &quot;TRichEdit&quot; as the class name. If the control's 
   class name is unknown, the Sentry DLL will look for a special 
   class-name mapping entry in the SSCE.INI file or system registry. The 
   mapping entries are defined in the [SSCE User] section of SSCE.INI or 
   in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wintertree\SSCE tree of the system 
   registry. The property name is the name of the subclassed control, 
   and the value is a string containing the base class name. For 
   example, to map the &quot;TRichEdit&quot; class to 
   &quot;RICHEDIT&quot;, define a map entry similar to the following:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>TRichEdit=RICHEDIT</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
   If the control's class name is not recognized by the Sentry DLL, and 
   no mapping entry exists, the control is treated as an &quot;Edit&quot;
    control.</P>
  <P>
   Example programs included with the Sentry Windows SDK demonstrate one 
   technique for working with non-standard third-party controls.</P>

  <P>
   The Sentry DLL can check spelling of text in standard rich-text 
   controls in the background, as the user types. The <A HREF="winref.htm#SSCE_CheckCtrlBackg">SSCE_CheckCtrlBackground</A> 
   function is used to begin monitoring a rich-text control for 
   misspelled words. When a misspelled word is detected, Sentry changes 
   the word's color to red. When a misspelled word is later corrected, 
   Sentry changes its color to black. If the user right-clicks the mouse 
   over a misspelled word, Sentry pops up a context menu containing 
   suggested replacements.</P>
  <P>
   Only one control can be monitored at a time. When 
   SSCE_CheckCtrlBackground is called, Sentry stops monitoring the 
   current control (if any) and begins monitoring the specified control. 
   If you need to monitor several controls, catch the &quot;Set 
   Focus&quot; event (EN_SETFOCUS) and monitor the control which has the 
   input focus.</P>
  <P>
   Only standard rich-edit controls (RichTextBoxes in Visual Basic, 
   TRichEdit controls in Delphi, and CRichEditCtrls in MFC) can be 
   monitored. Controls which are derived or subclassed from the standard 
   rich-text controls can also be monitored, as can third-party controls 
   that exactly emulate the behavior of the standard controls at the 
   message level (at the time of writing, no known third-party controls 
   apply). If Sentry doesn't know how to deal with the control, 
   SSCE_CheckCtrlBackground will return an <A HREF="coreref.htm#ErrorCodes">error
    code</A>. See <A HREF="#ThirdPartyControls">Checking third-party controls</A> 
   for more information on dealing with third-party and subclassed controls.</P>
  <P>
   There is currently no way to change the color used to mark misspelled 
   words (red), nor is there any way to have a &quot;wavy red line&quot; 
   drawn under misspelled words. Corrected words are always changed to 
   black, regardless of their original color.</P>
  <P>
   Suggestions displayed in the pop-up context menu are obtained using 
   the current settings of the PhoneticSuggestions, 
   TypographicalSuggestions, and MinSuggestionDepth <A HREF="winref.htm#Properties">properties</A>.
    The pop-up context menu also contains an Add item which, when 
   selected, adds the word to the user lexicon indicated by the 
   LastSelectedLex property. Please note that if a context menu is 
   configured for the monitored control by your application, both 
   context menus will be displayed.</P>

  <P>
   Sentry can interactively check the spelling of words in a string 
   using the <A HREF="winref.htm#SSCE_CheckBlockDlg">SSCE_CheckBlockDlg</A> 
   function. The string can contain one or more words - a sentence, a 
   paragraph, an entire document, or just a single word. The Sentry DLL 
   identifies words contained within a string as follows: A word is an 
   alphanumeric character followed by any sequence of alphanumerics or 
   apostrophes. Periods surrounded by alphanumerics are considered part 
   of the word, and trailing periods are considered part of the word if 
   the word contains embedded periods interspersed among no more than 
   two consecutive alphanumerics (e.g., the period at the end of <I>U.S.A.</I> 
   is considered part of the word, but the periods at the end of <I>USA.</I> 
   and <I>wintertreesoftware.com.</I> are not). Hyphens surrounded by 
   alphanumerics are considered part of the word. Apostrophes at the end 
   of a word are considered part of the word if they are preceded by the 
   letter &quot;s&quot;. Any character not meeting these conditions 
   marks the end of a word. If the IgnoreHTMLMarkups <A HREF="winref.htm#Properties">property</A> 
   is set to 1, then any text surrounded by angle brackets (&lt;...&gt;) 
   is ignored, and any text preceded by an ampersand and terminated by a 
   semicolon (&amp;<I>xxx</I>;) is also ignored. Ideally, strings should 
   contain words as described above, separated by punctuation or white 
   space. However, strings may contain other information, such as binary 
   formatting. Note that if formatting information contains valid word 
   characters (as described above), the characters may be interpreted as 
   words, with unexpected results. In this case, your application may 
   need to extract words from the string and pass each word individually 
   to SSCE_CheckBlockDlg.</P>
  <P>
   A string is a character array containing some text. A string's array 
   should be larger than the text it contains to allow room for growth. 
   When your application calls SSCE_CheckBlockDlg, you pass the size of 
   the character array and the number of text characters it contains 
   initially. The number of characters may change as a result of user 
   actions (e.g., replacing a shorter word with a longer one, or 
   deleting a doubled word). SSCE_CheckBlockDlg returns the new text 
   length. SSCE_CheckBlockDlg will not allow the text to grow larger 
   than the array size.</P>
  <P>
   When you call SSCE_CheckBlockDlg, words in the string are checked 
   according to the current spelling-checker options. If 
   SSCE_CheckBlockDlg finds a problem, it displays a dialog (the 
   Spelling-Checker dialog) which your user interacts with to correct or 
   dispose of the problem. If no problems are detected, the dialog 
   closes immediately.</P>
  <P>
   When SSCE_CheckBlockDlg returns, the entire string has been checked. 
   If the value returned by SSCE_CheckBlockDlg is positive, that value 
   is the new length of the string. If the return value is negative, the 
   user canceled the spelling check or some <A HREF="coreref.htm#ErrorCodes">error</A> 
   occurred. The string is updated with any changes made by the user.</P>
  <P>
   When the Spelling-Checker dialog box opens to report a misspelled 
   word, it can be difficult for users of your application to know where 
   the word appears in the text being checked. A parameter passed to 
   SSCE_CheckBlockDlg causes a special extended version of the 
   Spelling-Checker dialog to be used in place of the standard version. 
   The extended version has a context window that lets the user see the 
   misspelled words in context.</P>
  <P>
   A special form of the SSCE_CheckBlockDlg function 
   (SSCE_CheckBlockDlgTmplt) allows your application to specify the 
   dialog templates to be used in place of the templates built-in to the

   The Sentry DLL contains built-in Spelling, Dictionaries, and Options 
   dialog boxes, the appearances of which are determined by dialog 
   resources bound to the DLL. Your application can specify alternative 
   dialog template resources to be used in place of the built-in 
   resources. You could use this feature to make the dialog boxes 
   displayed by the Sentry DLL match the appearance of other dialogs 
   used by your application. You could also use this feature to make 
   certain modifications to the built-in dialogs, such as disabling and 
   hiding buttons you don't want your users to access or to change the 
   language of the text displayed by the dialogs (see <A HREF="#How2Localize">How

    <A HREF="winref.htm#SSCE_CheckCtrlDlg">SSCE_CheckCtrlDlg</A>, <A HREF="winref.htm#SSCE_EditLexDlg">SSCE_EditLexDlg</A>,
    and <A HREF="winref.htm#SSCE_OptionsDlg">SSCE_OptionsDlg</A> 
   functions. The &quot;Tmplt&quot; forms of these functions accept 
   parameters for the instance-handle of your application and the names 
   of the alternative dialog template resources to be used in place of 
   the built-in templates.</P>
  <P>
   The Spelling-Checker dialog box contains buttons which cause the 
   Dictionaries dialog or Options dialog to appear. For this reason, 
   templates for all three dialog types (Spelling-Checker, Dictionaries, 
   and Options) can be supplied to the SSCE_CheckBlockDlgTmplt and 
   SSCE_CheckCtrlDlgTmplt functions. In addition, a template can be 
   specified for the New Lexicon dialog, which can be displayed by the 
   Dictionaries dialog.</P>
  <P>
   The resource script used to create the built-in dialog boxes is 
   provided in the \ssce\sdk\lib\ssce.rc file. The definitions of the 
   resource ids used in this file are provided in 
   \ssce\sdk\include\res.h. You can use a resource editor to modify the 
   resource script; alternatively, you can modify it using a text editor 
   such as Notepad. If your application supplies alternative dialog 
   templates, the ids of controls on the alternative templates must 
   match the ids of controls on the built-in templates. For example, the 
   Ignore button on your alternative Check Spelling dialog template must 
   use the value of id ID_IGNORE_BTN. The control ids are specified in 
   the ssce.rc file.</P>
  <P>
   The alternative dialog template resources must be bound to your 
   application's executable image (its .EXE file) or to a DLL loaded by 
   your application. You will need the instance handle of the EXE or DLL 
   that contains the template resources. In Delphi, the instance handle 
   of the application is contained in the HInstance variable. In Visual 
   Basic, the application instance handle can be obtained from the 
   hInstance property of the App object.</P>
  <P>
   You will need a resource compiler to translate the resource script 
   into a .res file that can be bound to your application. Resource 
   compilers are typically included with C/C++ compilers.</P>
  <H3>
   How to use alternate dialog box template resources in Visual Basic</H3>
  <P>
   Before you can work with resource files in Visual Basic, you must 
   first load the Resource Editor Add-In. To load the Resource Editor 
   Add-In, select Add-In Manager from the Add-Ins menu. In the Add-In 
   Manager dialog box, select VB6 Resource Editor and check the 
   Loaded/Unloaded box.</P>
  <P>
   To create a resource file:</P>
  <OL>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Select Add New Resource File from the Project menu.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    In the Open A Resource File dialog box, enter a name for the resource 
    file. Be sure to give the file a .res extension. The resource file 
    will be added to the Related Documents node in the Project Explorer.</P>
   </OL>
  <P>
   To edit a resource file:</P>
  <OL>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Select Resource Editor from the Tools menu.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Select a button from the Resource Editor Toolbar to edit an existing 
    resource or add a new one. To learn more about editing resources, see 
    the Resource Editor Add-In documentation.</P>
   </OL>
  <P>
   Alternatively, you can use a resource editor and resource compiler 
   provided with a different product, such as VC++. After creating and 
   editing the resource file, compile it using the resource compiler to 
   create a .res file. The .res file can then be added to the Visual 
   Basic project.</P>
  <P>
   Note that the dialog template resources will <B>not</B> be available 
   if you run your project from the Visual Basic IDE. You <B>must</B> 
   create a .exe file before your dialog template resources will be available.</P>

   The most important aspect of internationalizing a spelling checker is 
   being able to check the spelling of text in the target language. 
   Wintertree Software has lexicons available in various European

   The dialog boxes displayed by the Sentry DLL by default use English 
   text for various labels, captions, and messages. Text for button 
   labels and control captions is usually stored in the dialog 
   templates. Text for error messages, changeable labels, and list-box 
   items is stored in a string table contained in the SSCE.INI file or 
   system registry. Note that the term &quot;string table&quot; as used 
   here is <I>not</I> the same as a string table contained within a 
   resource script. To make the Sentry DLL display text in a language 
   other than English, text in both the dialog templates and in the 
   string table must be changed. Specifically, your application must do 
   the following:</P>

  <P>
   The Sentry DLL displays various text strings for error messages, 
   items in list boxes, and changeable control labels. The text for 
   these strings is obtained from a string table. The string table is 
   stored in the SSCE.INI file or the system registry (see <A HREF="winref.htm#Properties">Sentry
    Properties</A> for a discussion of how property values are obtained).</P>
  <P>
   The string table is named; the name of the table used by the Sentry 
   DLL can be changed by your application at run time. The default 
   string table name is &quot;English&quot;. Each string in the table 
   has a default value in English; therefore, for applications which use 
   an English user interface, no string table need by provided: The 
   default strings are sufficient.</P>
  <P>
   To provide a string table for a language other than English, a 
   complete set of strings must be included. Typically, the string table 
   is named for the language of the strings it contains.</P>
  <P>
   When the string table is located in the SSCE.INI file, it is 
   contained in a section of the file with the same name as the string 
   table. For example, a string table named &quot;French&quot; would be 
   located in the [French] section of SSCE.INI.</P>
  <P>
   When the string table is located in the system registry, it is 
   located in a key below the current RegTreeName property. The key has 
   the same name as the string table name. For example, if the 
   RegTreeName property is Software\Wintertree\SSCE (the default) and 
   the string table name is &quot;French&quot;, the string table will be 
   located in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wintertree\SSCE\French.</P>

   <B>How to specify the string table name</B>: At run time, your 
   application can switch to a different string table by calling the <A HREF="winref.htm#SSCE_SetStringTable">SSCE_SetStringTableName</A> 
   function. Once SSCE_SetStringTableName is called, the Sentry DLL will 
   use the new string table name.</P>
  <P>
   <B>Using the alternate dialog templates</B>: The final step in having 
   the Sentry dialog boxes display text in a language other than English 
   is to call one of the SSCE_xxxDlgTmplt functions in the Sentry 
   Windows API. These functions accept the names of dialog templates 
   that will be used by the Sentry DLL in place of the built-in 
   templates. For more information, see <A HREF="#How2ChangeDialogApp">How
    to change the appearance of Sentry's dialog boxes</A>.</P>

       Sentry's Core API</FONT></TD>
    </TR>
   </TABLE></P>
  <P>
   If your application needs to call functions in the Sentry's Core API 
   (e.g., to set Core API options or to check the spelling of text 
   without interacting with the user) it can take advantage of the 
   initialization steps performed by the Sentry DLL by calling the <A HREF="winref.htm#SSCE_GetSid">SSCE_GetSid</A> function.</P>
  <P>
   The Sentry DLL automatically opens a Sentry session by calling the <A HREF="coreref.htm#SSCE_OpenSession">SSCE_OpenSession</A> 
   function. It also opens the lexicons listed in the MainLexFiles and 
   UserLexFiles <A HREF="winref.htm#Properties">properties</A> and sets 
   the options based on properties such as CaseSensitive and 
   TypographicalSuggestions. Your application can obtain the session id 
   containing these options and open lexicons via SSCE_GetSid. If your 
   application calls SSCE_GetSid, it doesn't need to call 
   SSCE_OpenSession, <A HREF="coreref.htm#SSCE_OpenLex">SSCE_OpenLex</A>,
    or <A HREF="coreref.htm#SSCE_SetOption">SSCE_SetOption</A>, because 
   these functions will already have been called.</P>
  <P>
   The session id returned by SSCE_GetSid is shared by all running 
   applications on the system which use the Sentry DLL. If one 
   application makes a change within the shared session, all other 
   sharing applications may be affected. In desktop-based applications 
   operated by a user this is not usually a problem, since changes such 
   as option settings are made at the user's request and presumably the 
   user's preferences apply to all applications.</P>
  <P>
   The session opened automatically by the Sentry DLL may be closed and 
   re-opened at any time for a variety of reasons. An application that 
   uses the session id returned by SSCE_GetSid should not rely on the 
   session remaining open between calls to the Sentry API. For this 
   reason, the session id should not be saved. Instead, your application 
   should call SSCE_GetSid each time it needs the session id.</P>
  <P>
   Because the session may be closed and re-opened at any time, text 
   blocks opened within the session may also be closed. Opening text 
   blocks within the shared session is therefore not recommended. 
   Instead, use <A HREF="coreref.htm#SSCE_CheckString">SSCE_CheckString</A> 
   function and related functions (see <A HREF="coreapi.htm#How2CheckString">How
    to check spelling of a string of words</A> for more information).</P>
  <P>
   Note that your application must not call <A HREF="coreref.htm#SSCE_CloseSession">SSCE_CloseSession</A> 
   for the session id returned by SSCE_GetSid. The Sentry DLL closes the 
   session (and its open lexicons) automatically when your application 
   terminates or when certain property values change. If you want to 
   ensure that the session is closed, your application can set a new 
   property value from the current value like this:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>char path[512];<BR>SSCE_GetMainLexPath(path, sizeof(path));<BR>SSCE_SetMainLexPath(path);</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
   At this point, the Sentry DLL will close its session and will reopen 
   it the next time a function is called.</P>
  <P>
   The shared session id returned by SSCE_GetSid should not be used in 
   non-interactive applications (e.g., applications that run in the 
   background), nor should it be used in multi-threaded applications 
   where there is a possibility that functions in Sentry's API may be 
   called concurrently. See <A HREF="coreapi.htm#AboutThreadSafety">About
    thread safety</A> for more information.</P>

    </TR>
   </TABLE></P>
  <P>
   If your application is installed on the same computer as another 
   application which also uses SSCE, conflicts can result that may 
   disable spell checking in either or both applications, or which may 
   cause other problems. Fortunately, there are some steps your 
   application can take to prevent this from occurring.</P>
  <P>
   The Sentry DLL is named to prevent incompatibilities caused by 
   changes to the Sentry API. Each time the Sentry API is changed, the 
   Sentry DLL name is changed. Thus, you can be assured that if you link 
   your application with SSCE5332.DLL, for example, all instances of 
   SSCE5332.DLL will contain the functions and parameters your 
   application expects. Sentry DLLs with other names (e.g., 
   SSCE5432.DLL) have a different API version, and may not work 
   correctly with your application.</P>
  <P>
   Similarly, the compressed lexicons (dictionaries) used by the Sentry 
   DLL have different names depending on the file-format version. (The 
   naming convention used for compressed lexicons is documented in <A HREF="coreapi.htm#AboutLexicons">About
    Sentry's lexicons</A>) Two or more applications can share the same 
   compressed lexicon without conflict, provided each application uses a 
   version of the Sentry engine which is compatible with the lexicon's 
   file format. You can determine which lexicon version is right for 
   your Sentry version by examining the names of the American or British 
   English lexicons included with SSCE. If the American English lexicon 
   in your version of Sentry is named SSCEAM2.CLX, then you should use 
   only lexicons with that file-format version (2) and not other 
   versions, such as SSCEAM1.CLX.</P>
  <P>
   The Sentry DLL provides built-in dialog boxes and other convenience 
   functions to simplify operation in the Windows environment. To 
   implement this, the DLL automatically opens lexicons and sets user 
   options. All applications which share the same Sentry DLL and use the 
   built-in dialog functions (e.g., <A HREF="winref.htm#SSCE_CheckCtrlDlg">SSCE_CheckCtrlDlg</A>,
    <A HREF="winref.htm#SSCE_CheckBlockDlg">SSCE_CheckBlockDlg</A>) also 
   share the open lexicons and options. If one application changes an 
   option, all sharing applications will be affected. In practice, this 
   is not as bad as it sounds, because option settings are usually made 
   on behalf of the user, and the same user is operating all sharing 
   applications, so the chances are good that the user wants the option 
   setting to apply to all spelling checks he or she performs. 
   Nevertheless, in some cases you may want to insulate your application 
   from the effects of changes made by other applications, and 
   techniques for doing so are described below.</P>
  <P>
   The Sentry DLL obtains information about which lexicons to open 
   automatically and which options to set from either the system 
   registry or an INI file. By default, the 32-bit Sentry DLL obtains 
   its settings from the Software\Wintertree\SSCE tree under 
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER. If two applications which use the 32-bit Sentry 
   DLL are installed on the same machine, and both let the Sentry DLL 
   use the default registry tree, and each have incompatible settings, 
   then problems will arise. Typically, the last application installed 
   will get the settings it needs, and the previously installed 
   application will no longer work. To prevent this from happening to 
   your application, configure Sentry settings under your application's 
   registry tree when it is installed, and call the <A HREF="winref.htm#SSCE_SetRegTreeName">SSCE_SetRegTreeName</A> 
   API function before you call other Sentry Windows API functions, such 
   as SSCE_CheckCtrlDlg. This will cause the Sentry DLL to get its 
   settings from your application's registry tree, which settings should 
   be appropriate for your application. For better efficiency, your 
   application can call <A HREF="winref.htm#SSCE_GetRegTreeName">SSCE_GetRegTreeName</A> 
   first, and call SSCE_SetRegTreeName only if the current registry tree 
   is not your application's tree. (A race condition exists, in that 
   another application could call SSCE_SetRegTreeName after your 
   application calls SSCE_GetRegTreeName or SSCE_SetRegTreeName, but the 
   chances of this happening are very small.)</P>
  <P>
   By default, the 16-bit Sentry DLL obtains its settings from the 
   SSCE.INI file. The SSCE.INI file is searched for in a specific way; 
   see <A HREF="winsdk.htm#HowSSCEIniIsLocated">How the Sentry DLL 
   locates the SSCE.INI file</A>. If two applications which use the 
   16-bit Sentry DLL are installed on the same machine, and each have 
   incompatible settings, then problems may arise. The Sentry DLL will 
   use the settings in the first SSCE.INI file it finds, which will 
   likely be associated with the first application to start. Also, if 
   both applications install the SSCE.INI in a common directory such as 
   the Windows directory, then the last application to be installed may 
   overwrite the settings of a previously installed application. To 
   protect your application from problems of this sort, call <A HREF="winref.htm#SSCE_SetIniFile">SSCE_SetIniFile</A> 
   before you call other Sentry Windows API functions, such as 
   SSCE_CheckCtrlDlg. This will cause the Sentry DLL to get its settings 
   from your application's SSCE.INI file (or other INI file), which 
   settings should be appropriate for your application.</P>

    Under Windows, DLLs are located by module name, not file name. 
    Placing a private copy of the Sentry DLL in your application's 
    directory does not guarantee your application won't share the DLL 
    with other applications, because Windows will use the loaded copy of 
    the DLL if the module names match.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    If your application calls <A HREF="coreref.htm#SSCE_OpenSession">SSCE_OpenSession</A>,
     then any settings made within that application will be private to 
    your application, so there is no need to worry about incompatibility problems.</P>
   <LI>
   <P>
    Sentry Windows API functions which begin with SSCE_Set usually save 
    the settings in the current registry tree or INI file. Call 
    SSCE_SetRegTreeName (32-bit DLL only) or SSCE_SetIniFile before 
    calling a SSCE_Set function to ensure the settings are saved where 
    you expect them to be saved.</P>
