	personalise and print your greeting card or project.  You can add, delete, or 
	change text and art elements.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	You can start by simply highlighting the 
	project's existing text message and begin typing.  Your keystrokes will change 
	the&nbsp;sentiment right on your screen.  You can also change the size, colour, 
	alignment and type of font used on your project, and add shapes or photos.<br> 
	<br>
	There are many other tools available in the workspace if you wish to create a 
	truly unique printed project.  Each button icon represents one of the tools in the workshop.  If you need a quick hint as to what each tool does,
	place the curser over the tool icon.  Hold the pointer over the tool icon 
	for a several seconds and the message will appear.<br>

	<p>
		Greeting card stock is generally best for greeting cards, notecards, 
		and announcements and is available at most office supply stores and many 
		department stores. Card stock is comparable to store-bought card quality, 
		and is pre-scored to make folding easier. But any high quality, heavyweight 
		paper is also great for your Create &amp; Print greeting cards, bookmarks, 
		certificates, and posters. CD Label Sheets are best for printing CD labels as 
		they have the adhesive to stick to the CD.  </p>
